TechLF
======

This library allows to control a TinyCN CNC controller from TechLF.

Development on this library has been stopped because the TechLF controllers are not
documented. Unless some documentation appears, you should consider trying a Soprolec
controller instead, because it is very well documented: I could achieve in one day
what I could not do with the TinyCN in several weeks.



We can instantiate a TinyCN class, representing the controler:

>>> from pycnic.techlf import TinyCN
>>> tiny = TinyCN()
>>> tiny.name
    'TinyCN'

We can turn off

>>> tiny.off()
