Pycnic
======

Pycnic is a Python wrapper around the Soprolec InterpCNC step motor controller. It was first started as a wrapper around a TechLF controller but I've given up.  The next step is to get rid of all these proprietary and sometimes poorly documented controllers to use an open Arduino board.
